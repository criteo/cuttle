/** A [[CronScheduler]] executes the set of Jobs at the time instants defined by Cron expressions.
  * Each [[com.criteo.cuttle.Job Job]] has it's own expression and executed separately from others.
  *
  * The [[com.criteo.cuttle.Scheduler Scheduler]] ensures that at least one
  * [[com.criteo.cuttle.Execution Execution]] is created and successfully run for a given time instant.
  * It also handles the retry policy.
  *
  * We follow the semantic of Cron on Unix systems and we don't manage misfires
  * (meaning that if the scheduler missed some events because it was offline,
  * or because a previous job execution was still running, we won't replay them).
  *
  * [[com.criteo.cuttle.Job Job]] is considered as finished when
  * we can't produce the next computing instant from Cron expression.
